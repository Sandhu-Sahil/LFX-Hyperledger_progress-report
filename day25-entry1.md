# Reading and implementing form the Raft paper/documentation

### Reading: https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf
### Implementing: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started_run_fabric.html

This might take weeks to complete, but did it anyway to get a feel of how it is to read and implement a paper and a documentation.

*Got many errors while implementing, but was able to resolve them by reading the documentation and the code.*

**ADVISE: Strictly follow the documentation and the code**
