# Implementing Raft Consensus Algorithm: A Journey of Distributed Consensus

## Introduction

Consensus algorithms are the backbone of distributed systems, ensuring that multiple nodes agree on the same state despite failures or network issues. In this blog post, we'll delve into my experience of implementing the Raft consensus algorithm and the exciting results I've achieved.

## Raft: Simplifying Consensus

**Raft** is a consensus algorithm designed for distributed systems. It simplifies the complexity of other consensus algorithms like Paxos, making it more accessible for implementation and understanding. Raft divides nodes into three roles: Leader, Follower, and Candidate, and utilizes a leader election mechanism to maintain consistency.

## My Raft Implementation

Excited to deepen my understanding of consensus algorithms, I decided to implement Raft from scratch. The entire journey was both challenging and enlightening. I documented my progress and code on my GitHub repository, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Sandhu-Sahil/raft-implementation).

## Steps of Implementation

1. **Understanding Raft**: I started by reading the original Raft paper, which provides a comprehensive overview of the algorithm's components and mechanisms.

2. **Designing the Code**: With a solid understanding of Raft's concepts, I designed the code structure and defined the roles of nodes, leader election, log replication, and more.

3. **Coding with Care**: Translating the paper's theoretical concepts into actual code required careful attention to detail. I wrote functions for each component, ensuring correctness and efficiency.

4. **Testing Rigorously**: Rigorous testing is crucial in distributed systems. I designed various scenarios, including network partitions and node failures, to verify the correctness of my implementation.

5. **Debugging and Optimization**: Debugging was a significant part of the process. I addressed edge cases, fine-tuned parameters, and optimized performance for a smooth execution.

## Results and Test Visualization

The culmination of my efforts is reflected in the test results. I'm excited to share that I successfully implemented Raft! To showcase the outcomes, I generated visualizations of the tests in the form of HTML reports. You can explore the test results and visualizations [here](https://sandhu-sahil.github.io/raft-implementation/).

## Learning and Growth

Implementing Raft has been an invaluable learning experience. It allowed me to deepen my knowledge of distributed systems, consensus algorithms, and the challenges involved in building robust systems.

## Conclusion

My journey of implementing the Raft consensus algorithm has been both rewarding and educational. Through understanding the theory, designing the code, rigorous testing, and optimizing performance, I successfully implemented a critical component of distributed systems.

As I continue to learn and explore the world of blockchain and distributed systems, I'm excited about the possibilities and challenges that lie ahead. I encourage you to dive into my implementation, test results, and visualizations to see firsthand the power and complexity of consensus algorithms.
