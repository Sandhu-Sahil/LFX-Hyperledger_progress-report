### Task Outline and Assignment

- Start with public blockchain learning and complete a course in Ethereum development.
- Move to private blockchain, specifically Hyperledger, and read papers on its consensus mechanisms.
- Implement example projects using [fabric-samples](https://github.com/Sandhu-Sahil/fabric-samples) and [Hyperledger Fabric documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- Build a mango tracking system using microFab and perform testing.
- Further implementation details can be found in the provided GitHub repositories: [bootstrapping-hyperledger](https://github.com/Sandhu-Sahil/bootstrapping-hyperledger) and [mango-tracking-sys](https://github.com/Sandhu-Sahil/mango-tracking-sys).

### Raft Implementation
