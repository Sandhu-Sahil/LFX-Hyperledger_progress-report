# üêô Running Code from Other Contracts Inside Your Own through .delegatecall(...)

In the world of smart contracts, the ability to interact with other contracts is a powerful feature. Solidity, the most popular programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, provides a function called `.delegatecall(...)` that allows a contract to execute code from another contract. This functionality opens up new possibilities for composing contracts and reusing code. However, it also introduces certain risks that developers must be aware of.

## üòï Wait, What?

When a contract uses `.delegatecall(...)`, it can execute code from another contract in the context of its own storage and state. This means that the called contract can modify the state of the calling contract, including its storage variables. This is different from a regular `.call(...)` or `.transfer(...)` operation, where the called contract operates in its own context and cannot modify the state of the calling contract.

This feature is particularly useful when building upgradeable contracts. By separating the logic of a contract from its storage, developers can upgrade the contract's functionality while preserving its state.

## Actual Use Cases

1. **Proxy Contracts**: `.delegatecall(...)` is widely used in proxy contracts. A proxy contract acts as an intermediary between users and the main logic contract. The proxy contract can use `.delegatecall(...)` to forward function calls to the main logic contract while preserving the proxy's storage and state.

2. **Shared Libraries**: Smart contracts can use `.delegatecall(...)` to call functions from shared libraries. This allows developers to save gas by reusing code rather than duplicating it in multiple contracts.

## Attack Using .delegatecall(...)

While `.delegatecall(...)` is a powerful tool, it can also lead to security vulnerabilities if not used carefully. One common attack vector is the "DelegateCallProxy" attack, where malicious code tricks a proxy contract into executing unintended functions from the attacker's contract. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data or manipulation of the proxy contract's state.

## üëÆ Prevention

To prevent the "DelegateCallProxy" attack and other security issues, developers should follow best practices:

1. **Be Cautious**: Exercise caution when using `.delegatecall(...)` and ensure that the called contract is trusted and secure.

2. **Access Control**: Implement access control mechanisms to limit who can call certain functions through `.delegatecall(...)`.

3. **Auditability**: Use thorough code reviews and security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities in your contracts.

4. **Use Libraries with Caution**: When using shared libraries through `.delegatecall(...)`, ensure that the library code is thoroughly tested and secure.

By adopting these preventive measures and understanding the implications of using `.delegatecall(...)`, developers can harness the power of code reuse and contract composition without compromising the security of their smart contracts.
